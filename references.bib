 abstract = {The multivariate t distribution has many potential applications in applied statistics. Current computational advances will make it routinely available in practice in the near future. Here we focus on maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the multivariate t, with known and unknown degrees of freedom, with and without missing data, and with and without covariates. We describe EM, ECM and ECME algorithms and indicate their relative computational efficiencies. All three algorithms are analytically quite simple, and all have stable monotone convergence to a local maximum likelihood estimate. ECME, however, can have a dramatically faster rate of convergence.},

abstract ={This paper gives three related results: (i) a new, simple, fast, monotonically converging algorithm for deriving the L1-median of a data cloud in ℝd, a problem that can be traced to Fermat and has fascinated applied mathematicians for over three centuries; (ii) a new general definition for depth functions, as functions of multivariate medians, so that different definitions of medians will, correspondingly, give rise to different dept functions; and (iii) a simple closed-form formula of the L1-depth function for a given data cloud in ℝd.},
